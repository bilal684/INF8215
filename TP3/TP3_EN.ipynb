    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part you will implement **softmax regression**, the **logistic regression** variant which allows you to perform classification for a class number greater than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to be completed is in the **SoftmaxClassifier.py** file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this exercise, the constraint is to use only the numpy library **\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sklearn encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The class **SoftmaxClassifier** inherits from the **BaseEstimator** and **ClassifierMixin** classes from **scikit-learn** which will allow us to easily use the tools provided by scikit-learn with our classifier later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For compatibility, the classifier necessarily implements the methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **fit**: responsible for training the model\n",
    "* **predict_proba**: Predicts the probability of each class for each example in the dataset provided.\n",
    "* **predict**: Predicts the class for each example in the provided dataset.\n",
    "* **score**: quantifies the difference between the predicted classes and the actual classes for the dataset provided\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train/Test set:\n",
    "\n",
    "When one wants to test the performance of learning a machine learning algorithm, one **does not test it on the data used for learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, what interests us is that our algorithm is able to generalize its predictions to the data that it has never seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, if we test an algorithm on the training data, we test its ability to **learn by heart** the dataset and not to **generalize**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when receiving a new dataset, the first thing to do is to **split it into two parts**: a **train set** (**70-80%** of the dataset) and a **test set** (**20-30%** of the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "All **data processing** and **learning algorithms** should be learned only on the training set and then applied to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, the lack of prior knowledge of the test set during training is ensured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is an algorithm that allows finding the optimal solution of a certain number of problems. The principle is as follows: we define a **cost function J** that characterizes the problem.\n",
    "This function depends on a set of **$\\theta$** parameters. Gradient descent seeks to **minimize** the cost function by **iteratively modifying** the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function gradient for a given $\\theta$, is the direction in which $\\theta$ must be modified to reduce the value of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function is minimal when the gradient is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, we initialize $\\theta$ randomly, and we do at each iteration a step to reduce the cost function until convergence of the algorithm to a minimum of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate represents the size of the step that will be made in the direction of the gradient.\n",
    "The larger it is, the faster the convergence, but there is a risk that the algorithm will diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller it is, the slower the convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several gradient descent algorithms. We will use Batch gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, before updating $\\theta$, we calculate the gradients on all the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a step of the gradient descent, a single gradient update.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias/Variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a machine learning algorithm we look for a tradeoff between **bias** and **variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model with a **strong bias**, is a model that is **too simple** for the given data structure (e.g., a linear model for quadratic data), this limits the capacity of the model to generalize. We also call bias  **underfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model with a **high variance** means that it is sensitive to small variations in training data, this corresponds to **overfitting**, i.e., the model is too close to the structure of the training set which **limits its ability to generalize**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model with a **significant bias** will have a **poor** performance over the **training set**.\n",
    "A model with a **significant variance** will have a much worse **performance** on the entire **test set** than on the  **train set**.\n",

La matrice résultant serait beaucoup trop grande. Ainsi, nous avons accepter de perdre de l'information sur cette colonne en extrayant uniquement le fait qu'un animal soit un hybride entre deux animal ou non (un mix ou non). Au moins, nous aurons extrait de l'information de cette colonne plutôt que de l'ignorer complètement. Ainsi, pour déterminer si l'animal est un mix ou non, nous avons vérifié si l'entrée dans cette colonne contenait le mot \"mix\" ou si elle contenait un séparateur \"/\". Si l'animal est un mix, alors on mettra la valeur \"1\" à la ligne correspondante. Sinon, on mettre un \"0\"."

We can see a difference on class proportions. For instance the proportion of the first class in the validation set is apparently larger than in the training set.  \n",
